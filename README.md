# LPU-Faculty-on-Leave-Reminders-Android

Get faculty on leave notification from LPU UMS at morning and save your day!

Greetings of the day!

DISCLAIMER: This app is only for Lovely Professional University students.

If you have ever come running to class only to find that <b>the faculty was on leave</b> then this app is for you.

This app can tell you which faculty is on leave <b>before you wake up!</b>

You just have to do the following steps:
â€¢ Select time (say 8 AM) & days of the week (say Mon-Fri) at which reminder should be given
â€¢ And thatâ€™s it

The app switches Wi-Fi on at the chosen time, checks the faculty on leave from LPU UMS, turns off Wi-Fi and displays notification. All this automatically! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
If packet data is available it will not use Wi-Fi.

If you want half day reminders for faculty on leave then that option is available too in Settings!

The app has the following features:
â€¢ Check Faculty on Leave manually under 5 sec and share it with friends!
â€¢ Schedule Faculty on Leave in morning at chosen time.
â€¢ Schedule Faculty on Leave after 12 PM for faculties who take a half day
â€¢ Option to switch Wi-Fi off or not after reminder delivery
â€¢ Option to not switch Wi-Fi off if downloading
â€¢ Option to use packet data if there
â€¢ Change Profile Picture, Scheduler's wallpaper and Sidebar wallpaper in the app
â€¢ The app dynamically adjusts according to your chosen wallpaper!
â€¢ Change password if changed in UMS
â€¢ Very low on bandwidth (48 KB per Faculty on Leave check!)
â€¢ Extremely Battery efficient (1mAh in two weeks!)
â€¢ and NO Ads!!

I made this app coz it happened to me two times a month in winter that I woke up late and arrived running to attend the classes only to find that the faculty was on leave.ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢

So, I believe that this brutal thing won't happen with you. So, install, rate and share this app with your other friends coz sharing is caring.

Upcoming features:-
â€¢ Increase in FOL check performance by 50%!
â€¢ Check FOL at app startup
â€¢ Blacklist faculties (faculties will not be shown in FOL list)
â€¢ Check if password changed at app startup
â€¢ and much more. To request a feature visit - http://tinyurl.com/UPFeatures
